### Template 2: Story-Based

```
📊 Remember the frustration of managing church records in Excel?

I built something better. 

Introducing Data Entry App v1.2.0 - a professional offline data entry tool that just got a major upgrade:

🎯 The Problem:
Churches and organizations need reliable data entry without internet dependency, but existing tools are either too complex or require cloud subscriptions.

✨ The Solution:
A desktop app that works 100% offline with:
• Real-time validation (no more typos!)
• Bulk import from CSV/Excel
• Productivity keyboard shortcuts
• Fully customizable fields

🔓 100% Open Source & Free

Built with modern web tech (Electron + SQL.js) for reliability and portability.
